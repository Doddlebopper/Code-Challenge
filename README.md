# Code-Challenge
This is a terminal based word guessing game written in C++ using:
-CPR for HTTP requests
-nlohmann/json for JSON parsing

Make sure your using a C++ compiler that is C++17 or newer or else it won't work.

How to run:
(Note: It might take a while for vcpkg to download and I apologize for that but I didn't find another way to implement an API)
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `vcpkg integrate install`
3. Run `vcpkg install cpr nlohmann-json`
4. Open `Coding-Challenge.sln` in your ide of choice
5. Build <- (Very Important) and run!
